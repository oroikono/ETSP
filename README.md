# Comprehensive Data Visualization and Model Training Repository

This repository is a one-stop resource for training a pix2struct model, evaluating its performance, and diving into versatile data visualizations with the GraphSay class, which forms the basis for an upcoming visualization library.

## Repository Structure

- `dataset/`: Contains the datasets required for training and evaluating the model.
- `training/`: Includes resources and guidelines for training the pix2struct model.
- `evaluation/`: Provides tools for evaluating the trained model and analyzing its performance.
- `library/`: Introduces the GraphSay class with use cases, setting the stage for a future comprehensive visualization library.

## Training the Model

The `training/` directory contains all the necessary tools and instructions for training your pix2struct model. Detailed steps and requirements are outlined in the README within this directory.
