# GraphSay : A Python Library for Automated Graph Captioning

This repository is a one-stop resource for finetuning Google's Pix2struct model[Pix2Struct:Paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Pix2Struct%3A-Screenshot-Parsing-as-Pretraining-for-Lee-Joshi/e1484706c0fab932fc9804df328044b3cb2f110d), evaluating its performance on a custom dataset derived from [Chart-to-Text:Paper](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.277/), and diving into charts' caption generation via GraphSay class, which forms the basis for an upcoming Chart-Captioning library.

## Repository Structure

- `./dataset`: Contains the datasets required for training and evaluating the model.
- `./training`: Includes resources and guidelines for finetuning  Google's Pix2struct model.
- `./evaluation`: Provides tools for evaluating the trained model and analyzing its performance.
- `./library`: Introduces the GraphSay class with use cases, setting the stage for a future chart captioning library.

## Dataset preparation

The `./dataset` directory contains all the necessary tools and instructions to prepare the dataset for training and evaluation. Detailed steps and requirements are outlined in the README within this directory.
