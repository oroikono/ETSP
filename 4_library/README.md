# GraphSay: Foundation for a New Visualization Library

Here you can find use cases of the GraphSay class, a versatile powerhouse for data visualization needs. This class is the cornerstone of an upcoming comprehensive library. It currently supports a variety of plots from renowned libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly.

## Exploring Use Cases

The provided notebook, "GraphSay_UseCases.ipynb," is an interactive Python notebook that contains various use cases demonstrating the capabilities of the GraphSay class. 

### Getting Started

Before you begin, ensure you have the following requirements:

1. **Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory**: If you haven't installed Jupyter, you can do so using:
   ```
   pip install notebook
   ```
   Alternatively, you can use Google Colaboratory, which is a free Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup and runs entirely in the cloud.

2. **Required Libraries**: Make sure matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly are installed in your environment. You can install them using:
   ```
   pip install matplotlib seaborn plotly
   ```

### Launching the Notebook

- **Local Environment**:
  Navigate to the directory containing "GraphSay_UseCases.ipynb" and launch Jupyter Notebook by running:
  ```
  jupyter notebook
  ```
  Then, open "GraphSay_UseCases.ipynb" from the Jupyter Notebook dashboard.

- **Google Colaboratory**:
  Visit [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/), and upload "GraphSay_UseCases.ipynb" through the File menu. Once uploaded, you can run the notebook cells and explore the GraphSay class functionalities.

### Exploring the Class

The notebook is divided into sections, each showcasing a different capability of the GraphSay class. These sections provide code snippets and visualizations, giving you a clear understanding of what the class offers and how it can be used.

## Future Scope

The GraphSay class is just the beginning. It's structured to serve as the base for a future library that will offer extensive functionalities for data visualization. This upcoming library aims to provide a unified interface for creating a wide array of visualizations, catering to diverse requirements and preferences.
