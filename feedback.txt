FEEDBACK ON PROJECT PROPOSAL

--------------------------------------

NAMES:

Orestis Oikonomou, Hyeongkyun Kim

--------------------------------------

OVERALL STATUS:

Green - I think your project is feasible, you can go ahead with it,
possibly with minor changes.

--------------------------------------

ADDITIONAL REMARKS:

In addition to automatic metrics for your evaluation, make sure you do
some more fine-grained, in-depth analysis. It will be very important
that you look at the results manually for interesting insights. For
example, what is difficult in chart captioning? What is confusing the
model? Any recommendations for chart creators to make it more likely
that a caption can be generated automatically?

--------------------------------------

Good luck everyone with your projects!

Mathias, Zifan and Noah
